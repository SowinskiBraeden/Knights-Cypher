# Knights-Cypher

This is a little fun project I did in a Day. The Idea is that if you have a list of the alphabet in a 2 by 13 fasion.
You can use the way a knight in chess moves to change the letter. This makes this a simple encryptions for words.

No libraries are required, and the example is ready in the program.

I wrote this originally in JavaScript and then quickly made a Python version two. Both work equally.
